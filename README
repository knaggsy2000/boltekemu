Boltek Emulation - Release v0.1.2 on 23/05/2011
===============================================
Link: http://code.google.com/p/stormforce/

For license and copyright, please see the LICENSE file.


Preface
=======
This emulator has been created to allow testing of your Boltek-based software without the need for the actual hardware.  Very useful if you only have one unit which is currently live.

You require TWO serial ports AND a crossover (null modem) cable for this work correctly.  Put the emulator on one port and your software on the other port.

You only need ONE external package to be installed - serial.  This is required.


Notes
=====
v0.1.2 - 23rd May 2011
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
1. Corrected serial code when running under Windows.  Windows doesn't like XONXOFF set to NULL so it's now set to FALSE.

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
1. Boltek EFM-100 emulation.

v0.1.0 - 21st May 2011
